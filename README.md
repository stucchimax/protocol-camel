# The IPv6 Camel
The goal is to get a place where we can gather RFCs and drafts relevant to IPv6,
including the number of pages and the number of 'MUST' and 'SHOULD' statements.

You can browse the list here: https://rirstats.net/ipv6-camel/

## How you can help
In various ways:

 * The source file [ipv6-rfcs.js] does not contain (yet) the full list of RFCs and Drafts;
 * The output is pretty ugly, CSS help is welcome!
 * There is no infrastructure yet to track drafts
